Based on this SQL query that will be executed:
{sql_query}

Write a SHORT, friendly message (max 3 sentences) that:
1. States what information you'll retrieve (in plain English, NO SQL terms)
2. Explains why this helps answer their question  
3. Ends with: "May I proceed?" or "Should I search for this?"

Rules:
- Use "I'll" or "I can" to describe the action
- Never mention: SQL, database, query, table, join, WHERE clause, etc.
- Be conversational and helpful
- Focus on the VALUE to the customer, not the technical process

Example formats:
"I'll search for [what] to show you [benefit]. This will help you [outcome]. May I proceed?"
"I can look up [information] which will [how it helps]. Should I go ahead?"

Write ONLY the message to show the customer.
